    <h1>CHEESE MAKING</h1>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_Subject/result.php?B4495177-A04A-3C0D-8910-3DBB28D8D054&sector=ANIMALS%20%26%20PRODUCTS&group=DAIRY&comm=CHEESE">United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service</a> in 2015, the U.S. produced 22,802,766,000 pounds of cheese.</p>
      <!--add more information here!-->

      <p>Making cheese all starts with milk. According to the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1103">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>, in Feb. 2017, the U.S. produced 15.7 billion gallons of milk. The first step in the cheese making process involves the pasteurization of the milk. This is done to rid the milk of any harmful bacteria.  </p>

      <p>Once the milk is pasteurized, coagulants are added to the liquid in a cheese vatâ€“ this process is called culturing. After the coagulants are added, the cheese vat agitates the soon-to-be curds and keeps them at an ideal temperature. The temperature of the cheese vat varies depending on the type of cheese being made.</p>

      <p>Below, the 3D model of the cheese vat shows the agitators moving. These are what agitates the liquid and helps distribute the coagulants. Attachments for the agitators varies depending on the model of cheese vat. The model below was created in the likes of <a href="http://www.dairyheritage.com/cheese-vats.php">this model</a> from <a href="http://www.dairyheritage.com/index.php">Dairy Heritage</a>, which is a vendor of milk processing equipment.</p>

      <p>After the cheese has been cultured, it's time for it to be cut. Some models of cheese vats have attachments for cutting the curd. The size of the curd cut depends on the type of cheese that is being made. The curds are then pressed depending on the type of cheese that is being made.</p>

      <p>Once the cheese has been pressed, it is brought to different rooms, with different environments to cure. After the cheese has finished curing the post-processing begins.</p>

      <p>In order to make shredded cheeses like the ones found in your local grocery store there is certain machinery that needs to be used. This is where the industrial shredders come into play.</p>
